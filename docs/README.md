# AFL Documentation

This folder contains AFL's documentation. It is currently built using
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

To build it locally, install sphinx and use `make html`.

Please strive to keep the documentation readable in plaintext form to facilitate
people reading without tooling just as AFL has done in the past with its
`.txt` files.

If you're reading this in plaintext, start from `index.rst` and work your way
down the table-of-contents.
